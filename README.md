## Introduction
This project aims to utilize artificial intelligence to detect various skin diseases from images. By leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this tool can assist dermatologists in diagnosing skin conditions more accurately and efficiently.

## Features
- **Automatic Detection**: Identify skin diseases from images with high accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use web application for uploading images and viewing results.
- **Extensible**: Easily add support for more skin diseases.
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Generate detailed reports of the analysis.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skin-disease-detection.git
    cd skin-disease-detection
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Download the dataset** (see [Dataset](#dataset) section)

5. **Run the application**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage
1. Launch the web application.
2. Upload an image of the skin condition.
3. Wait for the model to analyze the image.
4. View the results and the detailed report.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model can be found [here](link_to_dataset). It contains thousands of labeled images of various skin conditions.

## Model
The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The architecture includes several convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers designed to extract features from images and classify them into different skin disease categories.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of X% on the validation set. Below are some example predictions:

| Image | Predicted | Actual |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| ![Image1](link_to_image1) | Disease A | Disease A |
| ![Image2](link_to_image2) | Disease B | Disease B |
| ![Image3](link_to_image3) | Disease C | Disease C |
